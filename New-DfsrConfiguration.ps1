    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates a new DFSR replication group and one replicated folder on the specified file
        servers with the connection topology between them.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Creates a new replication group and a new replicated folder, adds member computers and the
        desired connection topology, and then configures memberships.  The local computer (where
        this script is run) must be running either Windows Server 2012 R2 with the DFSR role
        installed ('Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-DFS-Mgmt-Con'), or Windows 8.1 with RSAT installed
        from the Microsoft Download Center.  All member computers must be running Windows Server
        2012 R2 or later with the DFSR role installed.  All DFSR objects will be created in the
        current user's domain.
    .EXAMPLE
        .\New-DfsrConfiguration.ps1 -GroupName RG01 -FolderName RF01 -ComputerName SRV01,SRV02,SRV03 -PrimaryComputerName SRV01 -ContentPath C:\RF01 -Verbose

        - Creates a new replication group named "RG01" and a replicated folder named "RF01".
        - Adds the member computers named SRV01, SRV02, and SRV03 to "RG01".
        - Adds all six bidirectional pairwise connections between all three members (a full-mesh
          connection topology).
        - Configures all memberships to use C:\RF01 as the folder for the root of each member's
          local copy of "RF01".
        - Sets SRV01 to be the primary member computer.
    .EXAMPLE
        .\New-DfsrConfiguration.ps1 -GroupName RG02 -FolderName RF02 -HubComputerName SRV01 -ComputerName SRV02,SRV03 -PrimaryComputerName SRV03 -ContentPath C:\RF02 -Verbose

        - Creates a new replication group named "RG02" and a replicated folder named "RF02".
        - Adds the member computers named SRV01, SRV02, and SRV03 to "RG02".
        - Adds four connections: bidirectionally between SRV01 and each of SRV02 and SRV03.
        - Configures all memberships to use C:\RF02 as the folder for the root of each member's
          local copy of "RF02".
        - Sets SRV03 to be the primary member computer.
    .EXAMPLE
        .\New-DfsrConfiguration.ps1 -GroupName RG03 -FolderName RF03 -ComputerName SRV02,SRV03 -PrimaryComputerName SRV01 -ContentPath C:\RF03 -StagingPathQuotaInMB (1024 * 32) -Verbose

        - Creates a new replication group named "RG03" and a replicated folder named "RF03".
        - Adds the member computers named SRV01, SRV02, and SRV03 to "RG03".
        - Adds all six bidirectional pairwise connections between all three members (a full-mesh
          connection topology).
        - Configures all memberships to use C:\RF03 as the folder for the root of each member's
          local copy of "RF03".
        - Sets SRV01 to be the primary member computer and the staging quota to 32 GB.
